            <h2>Gowri Pooja</h2>
            <img src="gowri_pooja.jpg" alt="Gowri Pooja">
            <p>The actual wedding rituals begin with the groom offering prayers to the “Vignaharta – Lord Ganesha” at the mandap while the bride performs the Gowri puja. Goddess Gowri is synonymous with prosperity, harmony, purity, and strength. The bride takes a step towards a new phase in her life by invoking the blessings of Goddess Gowri. Another significant ritual is the “Pravara”. In most Andhra communities, families come from a certain lineage or ‘gothram’. In this ritual three generations of the bride and groom are recited thereby identifying their ancestry and lineage.</p>

            <h2>Jeelakarra-Bellam</h2>
            <img src="jeelakarra_bellam.jpg" alt="Jeelakarra-Bellam Ritual">
            <p>This is one of the most sacred and significant rituals in a traditional Andhra wedding. Jeelakarra-Bellam literally translates to ‘cumin-jaggery’, involves the couple placing a paste made from cumin seeds and jaggery on each other’s heads. This ritual is performed at an auspicious “muhurtham” that is decided by astrologically matching the groom and bride’s horoscopes. Cumin and Jaggery once made into a paste cannot be separated while maintaining their individual distinctive taste. This ritual symbolizes the inseparable bond between the bride and groom while bringing their individual personalities into the union.</p>

            <p>Mangal sutra Dharana is an emotional and significant ritual for the bride and groom. It involves the groom tying the Mangal sutra, a sacred thread with two golden discs “Sutrams” (one from her in-law’s side and the other from her family’s side), around the bride's neck, in three knots. The three knots signify the groom’s acceptance of the bride in Thoughts (Manasa), Speech (Vacha) and Actions (Karmana). The three knots also symbolize the coming together of their mind, body and soul. It is the beginning of their journey as husband and wife.</p>

            <p>Talambralu is one of the most joyous and playful rituals in a traditional wedding. The word Talambralu is a combination of the words talam (head) and bralu (shower). The ritual involves the bride and groom showering each other with a mixture of rice and turmeric. The rice symbolizes fertility, abundance, and sustenance, while the turmeric represents auspiciousness, purification, and protection from evil forces. The combination of these items signifies the couple's journey towards a life filled with prosperity, happiness, and spiritual fulfillment.</p>

The ritual involves the couple walking around a sacred fire in a clockwise direction, taking seven steps or seven circumambulations together. Each step is called a "phera". The seven steps represent the seven promises the couple make to each other. Some of these promises include loyalty, love, mutual respect and understanding.</p>
